public class DiffBetweenAbstractClassAndInterface {
/*
	1) Abstract classes are classes, so they are not restricted to other restrictions of the interface 
	in Java e.g. abstract class can have the state, but you cannot have the state on the interface 
	in Java.

	2) Another semantic difference between interface with default methods and abstract class is that 
	you can define constructors inside an abstract class, but you cannot define constructor inside 
	interface in Java.
